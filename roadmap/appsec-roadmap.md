## üìå 1. OWASP Top 10 (2021)

The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most common and critical security risks in web applications. Each entry represents a category of vulnerability and includes details on risk, impact, and remediation.

### A01: Broken Access Control
- **What**: Users can access resources or perform actions beyond their intended permissions.
- **Example**: A regular user accesses an admin page by changing the URL (`/admin`).
- **Mitigation**: Implement role-based access control, deny by default, and test all endpoints.

### A02: Cryptographic Failures
- **What**: Weak or missing encryption of sensitive data.
- **Example**: Transmitting passwords over HTTP, storing data without encryption.
- **Mitigation**: Use HTTPS, strong algorithms (AES-256), and secure key management.

### A03: Injection
- **What**: Malicious input alters the logic of an application.
- **Example**: SQL Injection (`' OR '1'='1` bypasses login).
- **Mitigation**: Use parameterized queries and input validation.
  
### A04: Insecure Design
- **What**: Flaws in system architecture and logic.
- **Example**: No limits on failed login attempts.
- **Mitigation**: Apply security principles during the design phase (e.g., least privilege).

### A05: Security Misconfiguration
- **What**: Default settings, exposed files, open ports, verbose errors.
- **Example**: Admin panels left open, stack traces shown to users.
- **Mitigation**: Harden environments, remove unused services, use secure headers.

### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- **What**: Using libraries or platforms with known vulnerabilities.
- **Example**: Running jQuery v1.7, which has XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor advisories.

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
- **What**: Weak login systems.
- **Example**: No multi-factor authentication (MFA), predictable credentials.
- **Mitigation**: Use MFA, limit login attempts, secure password storage.

### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
- **What**: Unverified code or updates, lack of integrity checks.
- **Example**: Auto-update features downloading unsigned files.
- **Mitigation**: Sign code, enforce integrity via checksums and secure pipelines.

### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- **What**: Missing or ineffective logging.
- **Example**: No alert for failed login attempts or data exfiltration.
- **Mitigation**: Centralized logging, alerting, incident response planning.

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **What**: Attacker forces server to access internal resources.
- **Example**: Submitting URLs that access internal APIs (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
- **Mitigation**: Validate and restrict URLs, use firewall rules.

## üßë‚Äçüíª 2. Secure Coding Practices - In Depth

Secure coding reduces the attack surface at the development stage.

### Key Practices:
- **Input Validation**: Always validate user input.
  - Use whitelisting, not blacklisting.
  - Example: Restrict allowed file types in file uploads.

- **Output Encoding**: Encode data before rendering in the browser.
  - Prevents XSS attacks.
  - Use libraries like OWASP Java Encoder or `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP.
